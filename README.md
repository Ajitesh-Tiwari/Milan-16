# Milan-16
Cultural fest conducted by SRM University from 3rd March - 6th March, 2016

Milan, the national level cultural fest conducted by SRM University, is an annual event which is marked by a confluence of talents from all over the nation. At the time of its inception in the year 2008, Milan marked the beginning of an era in the cultural history of SRM university. What started out as an idea culminated into a full fledged endeavor to provide a holistic cultural experience to students. Through the due course of the last 8 years, Milan has churned our 7 spectacularly successful editions that have progressively evolved in terms of the number of events as well as the participants in attendance. With the expectation of over 15,000 students and over 100 events, SRM University proudly brings to you the 8th edition : Milan '16 - Live The Change.
